# Summary

Work heavily in progress.

It's designed for igus drylin RJ4JP-01-08 plastic bearings, so regular lm8uu might not fit nicely.

You need some long/thin zip ties and m3 nuts and screws.

Fan horn requires gluing or welding to connecting bracket.

The carriage has embedded m3 nuts, so remember to set a pause in your gcode/slicer software.
